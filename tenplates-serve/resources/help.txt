                 tenplates templates and handling form submissions

USAGE:
  tenplates-serve (-h|--help)
  tenplates-serve [(-i|--ip) <IP>] [(-p|--port) <PORT>] [(-n|--name) <NAME>] \
    [(-s|--set) <CFG>...] [(-g|--get) <CFG>...] [(-u|--urlencoded) <CFG>...] \
    [(-m|--multipart) <CFG>...]

ARGUMENTS:
  -g  --get         <CFG>   Enable a template to be served on a given route via
                            the GET http-method. See GET for details.
  -h  --help                Display this message.
  -i  --ip          <IP>    Listen on the ip address <IP>.
  -m  --multipart   <CFG>   Enable a handler to be served on a given route via
                            the POST http-method expecting an enctype of
                            multipart/form-data. See MULTIPART for details
  -n  --name        <NAME>  Use a tempdir prefixed by <NAME> when storing
                            form data.
  -p  --port        <PORT>  Listen on the port <PORT>.
  -s  --set         <CFG>   Store a variable in context. See VARIABLE for
                            details.
  -u  --urlencoded  <CFG>   Enable a handler to be served on a given route via
                            the POST http-method expecting an enctype of
                            application/x-www-form-urlencoded. See URLENCODED
                            for details.

GET:
  Expects a value in "<DELIMITER><URL-PATH><DELIMITER><PATH-TO-TEMPLATE>"
  format. The first DELIMITER is a single character which defines where the
  parsing of URL-PATH will stop and the parsing of PATH-TO-TEMPLATE will begin.
  URL-PATH is the route from the hostname at which to serve the template.
  PATH-TO-TEMPLATE is the relative or absolute file path at which to find the
  tenplates template that will be parsed. Any url parameters included in each
  request will be provided to the template with the prefix "params.".

MULTIPART:
  Expects a value in "<DELIMITER><URL-PATH><DELIMITER><COMMAND>" format. The
  first DELIMITER is a single character which defines where the parsing of
  URL-PATH will stop and the parsing of COMMAND will begin. URL-PATH is the
  route from the hostname at which to serve the handler. COMMAND is the command
  to execute when the handler is hit. COMMAND will be passed a single argument
  which represents the path to the tempdir which hold the saved form data. The
  form data is in the form of directories where each directory name is the form
  field name and the files within represent each instance of that form field
  name where the contents are the value of the form field submitted. The file
  names are in BASE26 represented by the english alphabet.

VARIABLE:
  Expects a value in "<DELIMITER><KEY><DELIMITER><VALUE>" format. The first
  DELIMITER is a single character which defines where the parsing of KEY will
  stop and the parsing of VALUE will begin. KEY is the variable's name. VALUE is
  the value.

URLENCODED:
  Expects a value in "<DELIMITER><URL-PATH><DELIMITER><COMMAND>" format. The
  first DELIMITER is a single character which defines where the parsing of
  URL-PATH will stop and the parsing of COMMAND will begin. URL-PATH is the
  route from the hostname at which to serve the handler. COMMAND is the command
  to execute when the handler is hit. COMMAND will be passed a single argument
  which represents the path to the tempdir which hold the saved form data. The
  form data is in the form of directories where each directory name is the form
  field name and the files within represent each instance of that form field
  name where the contents are the value of the form field submitted. The file
  names are in BASE26 represented by the english alphabet.
